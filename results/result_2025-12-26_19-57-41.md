# Quartiles Solver Result

Tiles: ab cd ef gh

---

To solve the Quartiles puzzle using the tiles provided (ab, cd, ef, gh) and adhering to the blocked words, let’s explore potential combinations:

1. **Combining Tiles:**
   - By examining the letter combinations from the tiles, we can form words while avoiding the blocked ones.
   - We could potentially look for valid words that use 2 or more tiles.

2. **Possible Words:**
   - "fade" (ef + cd)
   - "bead" (ab + cd)
   - "cage" (cd + ag)
   - "hade" (gh + ef)

After checking against the blocked words, we find that words like "fade" and "bead" fit the criteria while keeping the rules in mind.

Thus, our Quartiles Solver Output would be:

```markdown
- fade
- bead
```

INVALID: ag, arity, al, etc.
