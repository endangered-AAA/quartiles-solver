# Quartiles Solver Result

Tiles: ab cd ef gh

---

To solve the Quartiles puzzle with the tiles `ab`, `cd`, `ef`, `gh`, we need to find valid words without using the blocked words listed.

Starting with combinations to construct potential words:

1. **ab + cd**: abcd (not valid)
2. **ab + ef**: abef (not valid)
3. **ab + gh**: abgh (not valid)
4. **cd + ef**: cdef (valid)
5. **cd + gh**: cdgh (not valid)
6. **ef + gh**: efgh (not valid)

Combining the tiles leads us to:
- **cdef**: this is the only combination that produces a valid word.

Thus, the only word formed from the given tiles while avoiding the blocked words is `cdef`.

### Quartiles Solver Output:
```
cdef
```

No additional words need to be blocked as per the listed words.
