# Quartiles Solver Result

Tiles: ab cd ef gh

---

To solve the Quartiles puzzle with the provided tiles (ab, cd, ef, gh), let's identify valid combinations of these tiles while avoiding the blocked words. 

Given the tiles we have, here are some possible combinations:

1. **Combination**: `ab cd` 
   - No valid output since "ab" is blocked.
   
2. **Combination**: `ab ef`
   - No valid output since "ab" is blocked.

3. **Combination**: `ab gh`
   - No valid output since "ab" is blocked.

4. **Combination**: `cd ef`
   - Valid output: **code**, **fed**
   
5. **Combination**: `cd gh`
   - No valid output, no valid words formed from these combinations.

6. **Combination**: `ef gh`
   - Valid output: **ghef** (assuming it's hypothetically valid since existing dictionaries may not provide this as a valid word).

From analyzing the tiles, it seems the only valid combinations form:

- `code`
- `fed`

Thus the Quartiles Solver Output is:

```markdown
Valid Words:
- code
- fed
```

No additional words need to be blocked from the current ones provided.

No words should be blocked in the future.
